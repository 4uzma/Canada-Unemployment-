üìä Group 14 - Summary: Unemployment Rates Among Canadians with Different Educational Backgrounds (1991 vs. 2024)

üìå Introduction

Canada‚Äôs labor market has undergone significant changes over the past three decades, influenced by economic shifts, educational attainment, and demographic factors. This report examines unemployment rates across education levels (Postsecondary Diploma, Bachelor‚Äôs Degree, and University Degree), gender, and age groups in 1991 and 2024. The analysis aims to assess how education impacts employability, whether gender disparities persist, and how age influences job stability.

üîç Key Findings

1. üéì Education Level and Unemployment

Postsecondary Diploma holders saw the most significant improvement, with unemployment dropping from 8.04% in 1991 to 5.13% in 2024, reflecting a growing demand for vocational skills. Bachelor‚Äôs Degree holders experienced a modest decline in unemployment from 6.23% to 5.40%. University Degree holders remained relatively stable, with unemployment changing slightly from 5.34% to 5.31%. This suggests that while advanced degrees offer consistent employment advantages, they no longer guarantee superior outcomes. Vocational education has become increasingly valuable, challenging the assumption that university degrees offer the best job prospects.

2. ‚öß Gender Disparities Narrowed

In 1991, men with Bachelor‚Äôs Degrees had lower unemployment (5.68%) compared to women (6.98%). By 2024, the gap nearly closed, with men at 5.66% and women improving to 5.13%, reflecting women's growing participation in higher-wage sectors. Among Postsecondary Diploma holders, women outperformed men in 2024 (4.77% vs. 5.47%), a reversal of the 1991 trend. Overall, gender equity in employment has improved, although certain sector-specific barriers, especially in traditionally male-dominated fields, still require further attention.

3. üë• Age-Group Trends

Among youth aged 15‚Äì24, university graduates faced rising unemployment in 2024, with rates at 10.5% for men and 8.9% for women. In contrast, youth with Postsecondary Diplomas had better outcomes (7.5% for men and 7.47% for women), underscoring the value of hands-on, practical training. For prime-age workers (25‚Äì54), unemployment dropped across all education levels, with vocational training showing the strongest gains. Among older workers (55‚Äì64), those with Postsecondary Diplomas benefited significantly from experience, with unemployment falling to 5.3% for men and 4.0% for women. These trends suggest that while youth require targeted support such as apprenticeships and entry-level opportunities, older workers thrive with a combination of experience and vocational skills.

üß† Hypotheses Revisited

Education Level: Postsecondary Diploma holders initially had higher unemployment rates in 1991 but outperformed Bachelor‚Äôs Degree holders by 2024. This hypothesis is partially confirmed.

Gender Gap: Disparities between men and women shrank significantly, especially for those with higher education. This hypothesis is confirmed.

Age Groups: Youth continued to experience the highest unemployment, while older workers with vocational training excelled. This hypothesis is confirmed.

Changes Over Time: The most dramatic improvements were seen among Postsecondary Diploma holders. This hypothesis is confirmed.

‚úÖ Recommendations

Governments and educational institutions should expand vocational training by prioritizing funding for technical programs aligned with labor market needs. Youth employment programs should be introduced to bridge the gap for university-educated individuals, including internships and work-integrated learning opportunities. Gender equity measures such as mentorship and targeted policy incentives should encourage women‚Äôs participation in high-wage sectors. Finally, lifelong learning and skill-upgrading initiatives should be promoted to help older workers adapt to technological changes and evolving job demands.

üßæ Conclusion

The Canadian labor market has evolved over time to favor practical skills associated with Postsecondary Diplomas, reduce gender disparities, and reward experience among older workers. While university degrees still provide stable employment outcomes, they no longer dominate the job market. Policymakers must align educational strategies with labor market needs to address persistent challenges, particularly for youth and underrepresented groups.
